# Cursor2Swift

Cursor2Swift is a project boilerplate that leverages the power of [XcodeGen](https://github.com/yonaskolb/XcodeGen) to streamline the Xcode project generation process for Swift applications.

## Features

- Automated Xcode project generation
- Simplified project configuration using YAML or JSON
- Easy management of targets, configurations, and schemes
- Seamless integration with version control systems
- VS Code tasks for project generation, building, and linting

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:
- Xcode (latest stable version)
- [XcodeGen](https://github.com/yonaskolb/XcodeGen)
- [SwiftLint](https://github.com/realm/SwiftLint) (optional, for linting)

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/regenrek/Cursor2Swift.git
   cd Cursor2Swift
   ```

2. Customize the `project.yml` file to match your project requirements.

3. Use VS Code tasks to manage your project:
   - Generate Xcode Project: `CMD+SHIFT+B` > "Tasks: Run Task" > "Generate Xcode Project with XcodeGen"
   - Build Swift Project: `CMD+SHIFT+B` > "Tasks: Run Task" > "Build Swift Project"
   - Run SwiftLint: `CMD+SHIFT+B` > "Tasks: Run Task" > "Run SwiftLint"

   Note: The "Generate Xcode Project with XcodeGen" task runs automatically when you open the project folder.

4. Open the generated `.xcodeproj` file and start developing!

## Customization

Edit the `project.yml` file to customize your project settings, targets, and configurations. Refer to the [XcodeGen documentation](https://github.com/yonaskolb/XcodeGen/blob/master/Docs/ProjectSpec.md) for detailed information on available options.

## Benefits of Using XcodeGen

- **Version Control Friendly**: Keep your Xcode project configuration in a simple, readable format.
- **Reduced Merge Conflicts**: Eliminate `.xcodeproj` merge conflicts in team environments.
- **Consistency**: Ensure project structure consistency across team members and CI systems.
- **Automation**: Easily integrate project generation into your development and CI workflows.
